It is possible that the repository is private and only available to certain people or groups. You will need to contact the owner of the repository to see if you can gain access.
[mos@core ~]$ z "can something be called open source if access to the repository is restricted?"    (:|✔)  2:19PM
Response:

No, something cannot be called open source if access to the repository is restricted. Open source software licenses grant licensees various rights, including unrestricted access to the source code repository. If access to the repository is restricted, then the software does not meet the criteria to be considered open source.
