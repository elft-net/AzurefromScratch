# Devops Project
 
Building an CICD pipeline without leaning on "Azure DevOps" too much (to prevent Cloud Provider Lockin).
This project will be pushed to github and deployed by GitHub actions. We'll pick up the pace from there (Use Jenkins maybe ?)

```bash
install apache tomcat on workstation
mvn clean install (--OR-- ng build (angular)) ==>> Creates a .war file in target folder ==> which should be placed in webapps-folder
```
